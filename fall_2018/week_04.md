## Last Week's Accomplishments

i was assigned an issue to fix the sign in bug. currently im going around previous commit searching for
an old commit that didn't have the bug because i've been told it used to work fine

## This Week's Plan

continue trying to find the commit with a working sign in to implement it's code

## Anything Blocking?

i think there are some dependency errors when trying to look into previous commits so loading up the website
on a previous commit doesn't work sometimes

## Notes
