## Last Week's Accomplishments

this week i decided to work up making sign up work normally without verification.
right now the application allows you to sign up and on submission of a valid form
it will bring you to the default landing page with your account logged in. this ignored
verification completely but its closer to being usable for non rpi students or people
who dont opt into using CAS.

## This Week's Plan

add a barebones landing page after you log in to tell you that you have successfully logged in

## Anything Blocking?

just normal school work like a lot of homework due at the end of the week but my weekend is free
so it's very likely that i will get this finished
