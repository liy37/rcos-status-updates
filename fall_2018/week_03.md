## Last Week's Accomplishments

i was able to finish making the web application by following the tutorial. a lot of the information was helpful and 
talked about how MVC works through the use of scopes. ready to take on a issue in the github repo now

## This Week's Plan

ive been given an issue on the repo, hopefully i can make some progress over the week

## Anything Blocking?

code base is huge so its a lot of roaming around folders trying to track down a bug
