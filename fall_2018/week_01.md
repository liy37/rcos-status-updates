## Last Week's Accomplishments

this week i've cloned the project repo and started on looking at the code base.
most of the stack is unfamiliar to me so i started looking at the necessary frameworks required
i was able to find a mean stack tutorial online and am planning to look into it while reading up on documentation
about angular itself

## This Week's Plan

i plan to further familiarize myself with the code base and create test websites using the stack
to reinforce what ive learned from looking over the stack's documentation
ples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

## Anything Blocking?

the code base is fairly big so it is taking me quite a while to navigate around it. 

## Notes
