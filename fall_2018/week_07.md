## Last Week's Accomplishments

worked on the email verification bug. spent a lot of time reading up on angular docs and exploring how
email verification works in terms of how data is being moved from controller. found out that a flag is set
to false and never reset back to true when the form in the email is reset. learned a lot about how scope 
works and general angular directives

## This Week's Plan

going to try to the get the fix working hopefully if i have time to work on it

## Anything Blocking?

a lot of homework due the same day and thanksgiving coming up so there isn't much time for me to be near a computer
