## Last Week's Accomplishments

busy with studying for exams and school club admisitrative stuff, able to get a personal test
repo for mean stack working. turns out a lot of the packages were old because the tutorial was old so i had to install
older versions of dependencies to fix a lot of errors

## This Week's Plan

fairly free so i can commit a lot of time to this hopefully ill be ready to tackle issues on
the repo

## Anything Blocking?

frameworks are still confusing to me and still getting used to node

## Notes
