## Last Week's Accomplishments

sign up bug is fixed by removing non existent path. this leads to the email verification not existing because i'm assuming it was never implemented.
also found another bug that prevents sign up if you input an email in the database and try to put in a different email

## This Week's Plan

going to trying to make email verification working by researching how to it works by first making the path to work
trying to make a notification for after sign up to tell you sign up was successful

## Anything Blocking?

nothing really just need to research how email verification works

## Notes
