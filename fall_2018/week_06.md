## Last Week's Accomplishments

sign up bug is fixed by removing non existent path. this leads to the email verification not existing because i'm assuming it was never implemented.

## This Week's Plan

going to trying to make email verification working by researching how to it works by first making the path to work

## Anything Blocking?

nothing really just need to research how email verification works
