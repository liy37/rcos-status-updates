## Last Week's Accomplishments

continuted with trying to fix the sign in bug. discovered that a path to a folder was completely missing from the code base.
by looking through other parts of the code there are just incomplete lines where they lead to a path in the code base that doesn't exist
and that's the reason why a lot of the sign up functionality isn't working. it seems that in order to fix the issue i would have to pick up
where the person before stopped

## This Week's Plan

look at past commits to see if folder exists otherwise may need to code sign up functionality

## Anything Blocking?

none really just a whole lot of commits to go through to see if folder was deleted
